# VisionForEwell-Website
This is the website that I created for my CTEC Unit 21 Web design and prototyping course. The website was created for the Ewell Village Community Organization. It won first place in the best website category in my class and was selected to be used by the organisation. The website features Bootstrap CSS styling, the Fotorama API, and the Leaflet map API for additional functionality.

A video demonstration of the website is available here - https://dai.ly/k21ttSgnLFFRUUzwPXT
