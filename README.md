# VisionForEwell-Website
I developed this responsive and interactive website as apart of my CTEC IT Web Design and Prototyping course unit. The website was created for the Ewell Village community group to serve as a central hub for the local community. My website won first place in the best website category in my class and was selected to be used by the organisation. The website features Bootstrap5 CSS styling, the Fotorama API, and the Leaflet map JavaScript Library (Powered by OpenStreetMap) for additional functionality.

A video demonstration of the website is available here - https://dai.ly/k21ttSgnLFFRUUzwPXT
