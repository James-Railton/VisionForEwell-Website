				<p style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 100;">
					The village is situated on the spring line between the North Downs chalk and London Clay, with sources that supply the Hogsmill River. 
					Ewell is located in the northeast part of Surrey, not far from London, and is now part of the Borough of Epsom and Ewell.  
					In Tudor times, Ewell ended up losing some of its lands when Henry VIII had Nonsuch Palace built in the nearby parish of Cuddington.
					Nonsuch began construction in 1538. It was constructed in 1556 by the Earl of Arundel and sold to Elizabeth I in 1592 through his son-in-law, 
					Lord Lumley. It became demolished inÂ 1688 after losing popularity in the seventeenth century. in recent time the excavation uncovered a highly 
					adorned building. Even though many historical sites was demolished as a consequence of post-World Second World war construction activities, 
					High St, Spring Street, and Church Street still have a few wonderful old buildings, and that there are numerous public parks around the local area.

							In the village of Ewell, down a small street, a small jail can be found. It is so small that it would not even be considered a jail. 
							The jail is estimated to have been built in 1777. Although its primary purpose was to hold criminals, it also served as a store for the local fire extinguishing equipment for the local area. 
							The jail building is made of bricks, which was done to ensure that prisoners could not escape. Click the link below to find out more about Ewell Jail.
